/**
Fast Path Planner (aka FPP) is a motion planning framework inspired by
GcsTrajectoryOptimization. Rather than solving the full GCS problem,
considering the discrete and continuous variables simultaneously, FPP
alternates between solving the discrete and continuous problems to find a local
minima.

"Fast Path Planning Through Large Collections of Safe Boxes" by Tobia Marcucci,
Parth Nobel, Russ Tedrake, and Stephen Boyd.
https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/fpp.pdf

While the original paper considered regions defined only as axis-aligned
bounding boxes, this implementation supports more general convex regions, and
support for subgraphs.

FPP is (typically) faster than GcsTrajectoryOptimization, and by virtue of
using alternations, it can handle constraints on the derivatives (e.g.
acceleration constraints) which GcsTrajectoryOptimization cannot handle.
However, FPP is more limited on the class of convex constraints that it can
support.

The API for FPP should mirror the API for GcsTrajectoryOptimization to the
extent possible.
